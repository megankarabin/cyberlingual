Hi, I'm Megan. I'm a full-time Master's student in cognitive science of language at McMaster University, and I program and do data science in my spare time. Python is my "mother tongue", but I've been using R more recently, for academic purposes.

In my undergraduate degree I also majored in cognitive science of language. Other than English, I speak French and German, I think I can say I've mastered the basics of Portuguese (it's a work in progress), and I most recently started learning Russian. Ultra beginner at the moment...I'll be back with an update in 6 months. In my free time I play piano, do yoga, read philosophy and hang out with my dog. And pinball. I absolutely love pinball.

My love of programming was really ignited upon taking the Data Science Immersive (DSI) course with [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/), which gave me the kickstart I needed to start doing really cool stuff with code. Shoutout to my insanely talented instructor, [Max Humber](https://maxhumber.com/), who all of us in the Hydra cohort owe so much for being such a fantastic teacher. ðŸ’¯
