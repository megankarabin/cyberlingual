    "spaCy is a NLP tool for language and text processing. The most well-known package for NLP is NLTK, which though it's a robust, well-respected library, comes nowhere near spaCy in terms of user-friendliness when it comes to handling, parsing and presenting language data. Although spaCy definitely has ease-of-use on its side, I know there are people out there who are quite comfortable using NLTK. However, there are several features available in spaCy that simply don't exist in NLTK, so hopefully after this tutorial you'll be convinced that spaCy is the way to go! \n",
    "\n",
    "In part 1 of this tutorial, I'll go over the basics of spaCy, showing you first how to install and get started, and then helping you to become familiar with some of the core concepts and features built into spaCy.\n",

    "- tokens / tokenization (and lexical attributes of tokens, including parts-of-speech tags, syntactic dependencies, and lemmas, among several others) \n",
    "- match patterns (spaCy's superior version of regex)\n",
    "- entity identification\n",
    "- displaCy \n",
    "\n",
    "displaCy is spaCy's visualization package. With displaCy, we can view the syntactic dependencies of a doc (text object) in really pretty visualizations, as well as label and colour-code entities. "
