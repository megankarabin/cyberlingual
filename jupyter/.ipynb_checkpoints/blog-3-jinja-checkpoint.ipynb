    "In this post I'll explain how you can use Jinja filters to access python functions and libraries from within an html doc, as well as how to create new variables from _within_ your Jinja template (rather than from the python script linked to the template). I'll be assuming that readers are familiar with basic Jinja, but if you're totally new to it and want to brush up on the basics before reading further, check out [this blog post](https://vishalsharma01.github.io/Blog/blog-3.html)!"

    "### Recap: What is Jinja? \n",
    "\n",
    "Jinja is a python library and a **template engine**, which is a software designed to let you produce a text output from your code. Of course, in python, we could just do that using `print('your text output')`. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, what's special about a template engine and why might we need one? \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, Jinja enables your code to communicate with a template, like an HTML document, for example, which traditionally only allows for static inputs/outputs. HTML doesn't have an ability to use control flow, or encode mutable variables, for instance. There are many template engines out there, but Jinja is built specifically to interact with python. Using Jinja, we can actually use python programming within a text/HTML document such that our result outputs are consistent with any data (in models) we're using for our web application. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation \n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already done so, you can install Jinja by running either of the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "easy_install Jinja2\n",
    "pip install Jinja2\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If neither of these work and you're having trouble installing, check out the documentation [here](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/intro/#installation) for more detailed instructions. "
