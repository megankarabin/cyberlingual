    "Before getting into the nitty-gritty of what linear regression models do, and how to build one using python, we first need to address what, exactly, a \"linear regression\" IS. I struggled with this concept initially, I think because there are just so many little moving parts involved that one must wrap one's head around before seeing &mdash; and truly understanding &mdash; the bigger picture. \n",

    "While these definitions are correct and all make perfect sense **once you've already gotten a handle on what all of it means and refers to**, I think for absolute beginners it's still just a touch abstract. So let's break it down further &mdash; starting with the term itself. \n",

The final version will almost certainly be much more developed than the outline, and from the outline we couldn't know word for word what your final draft would sound like. But based on the outline&mdash;the \"model\"&mdash;we could predict in what direction you planned to take the essay and generally what the final product would look like at different points. \n",

Asking what the \"residuals\" are is the exact same thing as asking for the difference between two things, only calculating a residual denotes a **special** case of taking the difference of two numbers/values. We use the term residual in linear regression (rather than simply difference/subtraction) because we have specific, pre-designated candidates (y and yÌ‚) for the two values on which we're performing calculations.
